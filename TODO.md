# TODO

## URGENT

* Page template for all posts
* CSS parallax
* Disable features from config:
  * topbar
* Modals

## LATER

* Split styles into "base" and "skin"
* Get rid off Bootstrap
* Use Aramid grid / layout
* Get rid off jQuery?
* Forms styling (including Gravity Forms)
* Member account links / login page
* Move from Gulp to Webpack build process (or fix Mix build)
* WooCommerce support

* Simple breadcrumbs (no YoastSEO) (see: https://gist.github.com/tinotriste/5387124)
* admin theme options?
* i18n / translate ALL text?

# KNOWN bugs

* add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' ) only works in functions.php

## To be confirmed

* still an issue with file_exists on the SVG twig template (/lib/timber.php)
* fixed-positioned elements aren't fixed!
* js sourcemaps must be fixed
* dual topbar sometimes renders 'stacked' (on resize it seems)
* parallax needs security offset in the settings
